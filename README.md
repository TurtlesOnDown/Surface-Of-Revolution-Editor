# Surface-Of-Revolution-Editor
A Surface Of Revolution Editor that runs in your browswer using Javascript and WebGL.

## Description

This project was a way for me to learn how Javascript and WebGL worked together as well as teach myself the basics of 3D graphics. The code includes 3D rendering of objects, Phong Lighting models, multiple object rendering, third and first person objects, and texturing.
